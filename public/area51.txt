<b class='redd'>Area 51</b> is a very strange and mysterious facility, it is located in the southern portion of Nevada, 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas. the surrounding area is a popular tourist destination. there are many towns near there.  Area 51 was built during the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union as a testing facility for aircraft, including the U-2 and Blackbird reconnaissance planes. 
Although the real information is vague, it is believed that the US military still uses Area 51 to develop crazy and insane aircraft. About 1,500 people are believed to work there, many commuting on charter flights from Las Vegas.

 A person named Matty Roberts, 20, created a Facebook event proposing that "we can run faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens". Two million people said they were "going", although a linked festival has since been moved because of fears of a disaster". this was a recent event it happend in 2019 before <b class='greenn'>covid </b> Less than a hundred people arrived at  the raid in Nevada of area 51 leading to a disappointing event and nobody successfully penetrating even the first outer fence, according to ABC News. <br>
 so why do people believe in aliens?? <br>
 As I said before area 51 used to be a military hangar,
 And it held planes such as 
 
  U-2 Dragon Lady.  A-12 Oxcart & SR-71   Soviet MiG-21        F-117 Nighthawk all very starge and unqiue looking aircraft some looking like ufos.  
 there is a lot of proof that area51 is not a facility for ailens. but too little for no proof that ailens arent real. area 51 is a very wierd and suspisuspicious place. and the fact that its in a random place in the dessert does not help. the fact is there is almost no info about this place so we cant really say whats happening but this is my thoughts.
