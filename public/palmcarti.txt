Paul Mcartney, one of the largest band members of the 60s supposably killed in a car accident and replaced by a look alike. One of the largest conspiracy theorys of the century is that Paul Mcartney(Beatles member) died and was replaced. According to the theory, McCartney died in a car crash and to spare the public, the Beatles replaced him with the winner of a look-alike contest, (Billy shears). People have found lots of proof to back up this theory. First another member of the Beatles (John Lennon) can be heard singing the words “I buried Paul in strawberry fields forever” referring to Pauls death. John can also be heard in another song saying “I’m so tired” wich played backwards sounds like Paul is dead, I miss him. While all of this is proof it isn’t good proof and it is really random. Although there is no good proof people still beleive this hoax to be true to this day. If there was more proof that actually made sense like an image of pauls death or some big characteristic difference in the so called Paul replacement then maybe this theory would make more sense and more people would believe it, but for now only a small few believe in the strange hoax.I personally do not believe this to be true just because of how bland the info is and it doesn't really make any sense.
